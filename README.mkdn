# NAME

Catalyst::ActionRole::MatchRequestAccepts - Dispatch actions based on HTTP Accept Header

# SYNOPSIS

    package MyApp::Controller::Foo;

    use Moose;
    use namespace::autoclean;

    BEGIN {
      extends 'Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole';
    }

    __PACKAGE__->config(
      action_roles => ['MatchRequestAccepts'],
    );

    sub for_html : Path Accept('plain/html') { ... }
    sub for_json : Path Method('application/json') { ... }

# DESCRIPTION

Lets you specify a match for the HTTP `Accept` Header, which is provided by
the [Catalyst](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst) `$ctx->request->headers` object.  You might wish to instead
look at [Catalyst::Action::REST](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Action::REST) if you are doing complex applications that
match different incoming request types, but if you are very fussy about how
your actions match, or if you are doing some simple ajaxy bits you might like
to use this instead of a full on package (like [Catalyst::Action::REST](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Action::REST) is.)

Currently the match performed is a pure equalty, no attempt to guess or infer
matches based on similarity are done.  If you need to match several variations
you can specify all the variations with multiple attribute declarations.  Right
now we don't support expression based matching, such as `text/*`, although
adding such would probably not be very hard (although I don't want to make the
logic here slow down our dispatch matching too much).

Please note that if you specify multiple `Accept` attributes on a single
action, those will be matched via an OR condition and not an AND condition.  In
other words we short circuit match the first action with at least one of the
`Accept` values appearing in the requested HTTP headers.  I think this is
correct since I imagine the purpose of multiple `Accept` attributes would be
to match several acceptable variations of a given type, not to match any of
several unrelated types.  However if you have a use case for this please let
me know.

If an action consumes this role, but no `Accept` attributes are found, the
action will simple accept all types.

For debugging purposes, if the [Catalyst](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst) debug flag is enabled, you can
override the HTTP Accept header with the `http-accept` query parameter.  This
makes it easy to force detect in testing or in your browser.  This feature is
NOT available when the debug flag is off.

Also, as usual you can specify attributes and information in th configuration
of your [Catalyst::Controller](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Controller) subclass:

    __PACKAGE__->config(
      action_roles => ['MatchRequestAccepts'],
      action => {
        our_action_json => { Path => 'json', Accept => 'JSON' },
      });

# EXAMPLE

The following example uses [Catalyst](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst) chaining to match one of two different
types of `Accept` headers, and to return the correct HTTP error message if
nothing is matched correctly:

    package MyApp::Web::Controller::Chained;

    use Moose;
    use namespace::autoclean;

    BEGIN {
      extends 'Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole';
    }

    __PACKAGE__->config(
      action_roles => ['MatchRequestAccepts'],
    );

    sub root : Chained('/') PathPrefix CaptureArgs(0) {}

      sub text_html
        : Chained('root') PathPart('') Accept('text/html') Args(0)
      {
        my ($self, $ctx) = @_;
        $ctx->response->body('text_html');
      }

      sub json
        : Chained('root') PathPart('') Accept('application/json') Args(0)
      {
        my ($self, $ctx) = @_;
        $ctx->response->body('json');
      }

      sub not_accepted
        : Chained('root') PathPart('') Args
      {
        my ($self, $ctx) = @_;
        $ctx->response->status(406);
        $ctx->response->body('error_not_accepted');
      }

    __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

In the given example, a `GET` request to `http://www.myapp.com/chained` will
match for `Accept` values of HTML and JSON, and will return a status 406 error
to all other requests.

# THANKS

Shout out to Florian Ragwitz <rafl@debian.org> for providing such a great
example in [Catalyst::ActionRole::MatchRequestMethod](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::ActionRole::MatchRequestMethod).  Source code and tests
are pretty much copied from his stuff.

I also cargo culted a chuck of code from [Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST)
which let me parse HTTP Accept lines.
